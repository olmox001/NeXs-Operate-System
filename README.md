# NeXs-Operate-System
A lightweight, purely custom 64-bit Operating System kernel and bootloader from scratch. It features a custom 2-stage bootloader that transitions from Real Mode to Long Mode, loads a Flat Binary kernel, and provides a dual-output (VGA+Serial) interactive shell with memory management and permission systems.
